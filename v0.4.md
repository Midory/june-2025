# Version 0.4: Monsters System

## 10 Ideas for Monsters
1. Add a monsters.json file to define monsters (name, HP, reward, image).
2. Display the current monster in the click area with its image and HP bar.
3. Each click (and hero DPS) damages the monster.
4. When a monster is defeated, reward the player with points and spawn a new monster.
5. Show monster name and HP visually.
6. Add a simple HP bar animation for damage.
7. Monsters get progressively harder (more HP, higher rewards).
8. Add a monster defeat animation (fade out or shake).
9. Track and display the number of monsters defeated.
10. Prepare for future monster types (bosses, special effects).
