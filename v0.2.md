# Version 0.2: Code Architecture, Readability, and Bugfixing

## 10 Major Points for v0.2
1. Refactor code into modular functions for clarity
2. Use a single game state object to manage all variables
3. Add comments and documentation for all functions
4. Use constants for magic numbers (e.g., initial upgrade cost, cost multiplier)
5. Separate DOM manipulation from game logic
6. Add error handling for localStorage operations
7. Use event delegation where possible
8. Improve variable and function naming for clarity
9. Fix any UI/UX bugs (e.g., feedback animation stacking, button states)
10. Prepare for future extensibility (e.g., upgrades array, achievements placeholder)
