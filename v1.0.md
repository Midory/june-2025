# Version 1.0: Canvas Auto-Battle Feature

## Vision
Chiptune Adventure will feature a dynamic, animated battle scene in the center of the screen. Using an HTML5 canvas, players will watch their recruited heroes automatically attack and defeat monsters in real time, bringing the world and characters to life.

## Key Features
- **Canvas Battle Area:**
  - A large canvas is displayed in the center of the UI, replacing or overlaying the static monster image.
  - Heroes and monsters are rendered as sprites or SVGs, animated with simple 16-bit style effects.
- **Hero Animation:**
  - Each owned hero appears on the left side of the canvas.
  - Heroes perform attack animations at intervals based on their DPS.
  - Heroes can have idle, attack, and hit frames.
- **Monster Animation:**
  - The current monster appears on the right side of the canvas.
  - Monster animates when hit, defeated, or idling.
- **Auto-Battle Logic:**
  - Heroes attack automatically; their combined DPS reduces the monster's HP.
  - Visual effects (slashes, projectiles, numbers) show damage.
  - When a monster is defeated, a new one appears with a transition.
- **UI Integration:**
  - The canvas is the visual centerpiece, with world, stats, and upgrades around it.
  - Clicking the canvas can still trigger manual attacks or special effects.

## Technical Specification
- **Canvas Setup:**
  - Use a `<canvas id="battle-canvas">` element, sized responsively (e.g., 600x300px desktop, 95vw mobile).
  - Canvas is layered above or instead of the static monster image.
- **Rendering Pipeline:**
  - Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps animation.
  - Clear and redraw the scene each frame: background, heroes, monster, effects.
  - Draw SVGs or rasterized sprites for heroes/monsters (convert SVG to Image for canvas if needed).
- **Entity System:**
  - Maintain arrays of hero and monster objects, each with position, state (idle, attack, hit), and animation frame.
  - Each hero/monster has a render method and an update method.
- **Animation:**
  - Animate movement (e.g., hero lunge, projectile, monster shake) by updating positions/frames.
  - Use simple frame-based or tweened animation for retro feel.
- **Damage & Effects:**
  - Show floating damage numbers, slashes, or projectiles when heroes attack.
  - Animate monster HP bar overlay on canvas or sync with UI.
- **Event Handling:**
  - Canvas listens for clicks/taps to trigger manual attacks or special effects.
- **Performance:**
  - Optimize for low memory/cpu: reuse objects, limit draw calls, throttle on low-power devices.
- **Extensibility:**
  - Design entity/animation system so new heroes, monsters, and effects can be added easily.
- **Fallback:**
  - If canvas is not supported, fall back to static monster image and UI.

## Stretch Goals
- **Special Abilities:** Some heroes or monsters have unique attack animations or effects.
- **Particle Effects:** Add sparkles, explosions, or retro-style hit flashes.
- **Sound FX:** Play 16-bit sound effects for attacks and monster defeats.
- **Customizable Battle Speed:** Let players adjust animation speed or skip to next monster.
