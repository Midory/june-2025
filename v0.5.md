# Version 0.5: Worlds & Exploration

## Vision
Chiptune Adventure expands beyond a single battlefield! In this update, players will journey through a series of unique worlds, each with its own monsters, art, music, and gameplay twists. Worlds add a sense of progression, discovery, and replayability, making the game feel like a true adventure.

## Key Features
- **World Map:** A parchment-style map UI lets players select and unlock new worlds as they progress.
- **Distinct Worlds:** Each world has its own theme (e.g., Forest, Cavern, Sky, Volcano, Dream), color palette, and background art.
- **World-Specific Monsters:** Monsters are unique to each world, with new SVG art and abilities.
- **Progression:** Defeating a set number of monsters or a world boss unlocks the next world.
- **World Bonuses:** Each world may grant special bonuses (e.g., increased DPS, unique upgrades, or temporary effects).
- **Chiptune Music:** Every world features a different 16-bit style music loop to match its mood.
- **Replayability:** Players can revisit previous worlds for extra rewards or achievements.

## UI/UX Ideas
- The world map appears as an ancient, hand-drawn parchment with clickable locations.
- Each world is represented by an illustrated icon or vignette.
- Transitions between worlds use magical page-turn or fade effects.
- The current world is always visible in the UI, with its name and a small icon.

## Stretch Goals
- **World Events:** Occasional random events or challenges in each world.
- **World Achievements:** Unique achievements for mastering each world.
- **Secret Worlds:** Hidden or unlockable worlds with special rewards.
