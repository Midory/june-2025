# June 2025 Game Project: Clicker Heroes-Inspired Game

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Create a small incremental/clicker game in JavaScript inspired by Clicker Heroes.
- **Platform:** Web (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- **Core Features:**
  - Clicking to earn points/currency
  - Upgrades to increase click value or automate earning
  - Simple UI with progress display
  - Save/load progress (local storage)

## Initial Ideas
- **Theme:** Fantasy, monsters, or something unique for June 2025
- **Art:** Use simple shapes or free assets to start
- **Monetization:** None (for fun/learning)
- **Stretch Goals:**
  - Achievements
  - Multiple upgrade paths
  - Simple animations

## Next Steps
1. Define core game loop (click, earn, upgrade)
   - Implemented in main.js: clicking earns points, upgrades increase click value.
2. Sketch UI layout
   - index.html and style.css provide a simple UI: click button, points display, upgrades section.
3. Set up project structure (index.html, main.js, style.css)
   - Project files created and structured.
4. Implement basic clicker logic
   - main.js: clicking the button increases points.
5. Add upgrades and progression
   - main.js: upgrade button increases click value and cost.
6. Polish UI and add features
   - Next: Add save/load progress, polish UI, and stretch goals.
